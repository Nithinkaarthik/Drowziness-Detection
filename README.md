# 🚗💤 Drowsiness Detection using OpenCV  


## 📌 Introduction  
Drowsiness detection is a crucial application in **road safety**, preventing accidents caused by driver fatigue.  
This project utilizes **OpenCV, dlib, imutils, and Pygame** to detect drowsiness based on the **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** and alerts the user with an alarm when drowsiness is detected.  

## 🎯 Features  
✅ **Real-time face and eye detection** using dlib's facial landmarks  
✅ **Calculates Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** to detect eye closure  
✅ **Plays an alert sound 🔊** when drowsiness is detected  
✅ **Visual feedback 👁️** with drawn contours around eyes
